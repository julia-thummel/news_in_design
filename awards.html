        <h2>Featured Award:</h2>
        <img src="images/bbdo.jpg">
        <p>If you think you've never heard of the ad agency BBDO, you're probably wrong. Their flare for advertising has reached far and wide, from online to on the TV to print to pretty much everywhere. BBDO has had more than their fair share of success recently, winning a handful of ADDY awards in 2015 and still going strong. One of their most recent campaigns was for Campbell's soup, where each can was given a different "can costume."</p>
        <p>BBDO is also the genius behind the commercials for Snicker's that you've probably seen before, that claim "you're not you when you're hungry." Part of this brand stream included creating a massive billboard in New York pointing to several nearby apartments and making jokes out of the inhabitants. One caption reads "thought that was the rent for the year, not for the month" with an arrow pointing at a neigboring window to a resident's apartment. At the bottom, the billboard reads "you make dumb decisions when you're hungry." Clearly, BBDO has been eating their snicker's bars, because they have yet to make dumb company decisions.</p>

        <p>Recently, students from Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design Avi Naim and Adar Rom coded a frame-by-frame short animation that combines both design and music, and has many professionals wondering where these kids came from and how to give them a job! The animation has won recognition from Communication Arts, a popular design magazine.
