        <h2><a href="http://perkinswill.com/people/hans-thummel" target="_blank">Hans Thummel</a></h2>
        <p>With over 30 years of experience in the field of architecture, Hans Thummel has contributed to a wide range of projects all over the globe, from public schools to the largest house in the world. Hans now works as an Associate Principal at Perkins + Will in their Chicago offices, but has worked at a number of architectural firms in the past including Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, as well as Lohan Associates. Hans is an alumni of Washington University in St. Louis, having majored in Architecture, and attended graduate school at the University of Virginia for architecture as well.</p>
        <p>Hans has earned the spotlight on New and Noteworthy thanks to his most recent work, the U.S. Coastguard Headquarters, which focuses on environment, both inside and outside the building. Rooftop gardens cover the building, which as most architects know, aids in keeping heating and cooling costs down by providing a layer of insulation. The unique inclusion of plant growth in the integral design of the building creates a focus on the environment that makes Hans the newest spotligt designer.</p>
