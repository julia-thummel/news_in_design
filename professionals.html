        <p>Just as painters might use different paints to create a picture, designers use typefaces to construct their designs. Any good designer knows that different typefaces will evoke different reactions from a viewer. But who knew those reactions could be measured? Communication Arts does research to see what typefaces work best for different bits of information.</p>

        <p>A trend has begun to surface as many design firms grow in size that shifts the focus of leadership from simply managing employees to engaging them in the work and creative process.
