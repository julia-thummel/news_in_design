        <p class="list grid_11">Ahh, the resume; nothing makes you feel quite so accomplished, yet so, so inadiquate. Here's five achievable goals to set for yourself so that when it comes time, your resume will rise to the occasion and help you stand out.
        <h2 class="box grid_11">1: Leave Out Distracting Graphics</h2>
          <p class="list grid_10"> As designers, we're hard wired to make things look "pretty." It only makes sense that our resumes should be a reflection of our capabilities in creating something visually interesting. However, when it comes to resumes, keeping it clean and simple will go a long way. You wouldn't want to be rejected from a company just because they look at your resume and don't agree with your personal aesthetic.</p>
        <h2 class="box grid_11">2: Don't Be Democratic in Your Descriptions</h2>
          <p class="list grid_10"> Who doesn't love good old fashioned democracy?? Resumes. If you had a great leadership role at a company or on a certain project, make sure to give that more attention and description than your summer job as a lifeguard at the beach.</p>
        <h2 class="box grid_11">3: List Concrete Skills</h2>
          <p class="list grid_10"> Companies see time and time again skills like "organized" on resumes, and companies know just as well as you do that these skills are just filler for your lack of concrete skill. To avoid beeing seen as incapable, instead of using filler skills say things you actually know how to do, like "front end development" or whip out the tried and true "adobe creative suite."</p>
        <h2 class="box grid_11">4: Follow Your Own Rules</h2>
          <p class="list grid_10"> The key to making a visually appealing resume that doesn't use too many distracting graphics is to create your own set of typographic rules, and follow them. For example, pick one typeface and stick to it. Choose a set of rules to organize your information, like specific margin and font sizes, and your resume will instantly look more professional.</p>
        <h2 class="box grid_11">5: Clear Descriptions</h2>
          <p class="list grid_10"> If you've held a position before that has a title worthy of explaining, explain it! Say you were the creative director of a project, or some kind of team leader. Being able to explain the work you do and the responsibilities you had will go a long way in making you stand out from the crowd as a strong contender for internships and job opportunities.</p>

        <p>UX and UI are different fields of design with desceptively similar names. They're not even real acronyms- UX stands for "user experience" while UI stands for "user interface." Both are incredibly important in creating great products like websites or apps, but while UX design is driven by the user's experience, UI design is driven by creating a particular visual language.</p>

        <p>Students at Carnegie Mellon School of Design get ready to use their design skills in the real world thanks to recent grants awarded to them. The grants, awarded by Kynamatrix Research Network are called "Innovation Through Collaboration" grants and seek to help students apply their design ideas not only in the field of design, but also in fields such as computer science.</p>

        <p>It's no secret: getting your first real internship is one of the hardest things about becoming a fully-fledged designer. All companies ever seem to want is more experience, which turns into a vicious cylce of feeling consistantly under-qualified for the internship you want, no matter what kind of degree you have or are pursuing. Here's some concrete tips on landing that first crucial meaningful internship.</p>

        <p>It's a frustrating part about being a design student that there are no definitive rankings of undergaduate design programs the way there are rankings for business schools or engineering schools, or just schools in general. But, there are resources out there that help students get the general idea of where they should set their sights on applying. This author is taking a second look at her life decisions after seeing Pratt Institute, a school to which she applied and was accepted, is consistently in the top ten list of schools for design.</p>

        <p>This election more than ever has younger generations going out to vote for who they want to be president. But what was keeping them from voting in the first place? Designers are now taking a second look at the voting experience, and applying a bit of good old tried and true user experience design to improve the way people cast their votes.</p>
